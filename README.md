# turtlesim_move
Package for motion example programs in turtlesim

gotogoal is from a ROS example tutorial. It uses Euclidean distance calculations to move the turtle to a specified end goal. 

show_stats is a helper program that prints out data about the turtle's current velocity and position. It uses the cursor to replace the previous values
instead of adding a new message to the end of the print output. 

The gotogoal_launch.launch launches turtlesim and these two nodes.
